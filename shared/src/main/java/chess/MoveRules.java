    //rook
    //change first number OR change second number

    //bishop
    //change both numbers to the same degree

    //knight
    //both numbers have to change, one number MUST be 1, the other MUST be 2.

    //pawn
    //idk how to get this one going....
    //I guess can only increase it's numbers by 1? and checking if it's attacking can be later, not sure about the first move being 2 tho...
